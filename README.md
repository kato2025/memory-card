Memory Game

Memory Game is a simple web-based game where players test their memory skills by matching pairs of cards. The game features a variety of images of animals fetched from an external API. The objective is to find all matching pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time.

How to Play

Start the Game: Click on any card to reveal the image underneath. This will start the game timer.
Find Matching Pairs: Click on another card to reveal its image. Try to remember the images on the cards you've already flipped over.
Match the Cards: If the images on the two cards match, they will remain face up. If not, they will be flipped face down again. Keep flipping cards and trying to make matches.
Win the Game: Continue matching pairs until all cards are face up. You win the game when all pairs are found.
Reset the Game: If you want to play again, you can reset the game by clicking on the reset button. This will shuffle the cards and reset the game timer.
